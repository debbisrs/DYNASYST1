# DYNASYST_0.3
DYNAmical SYSTem software to integrate ODEs, DDEs, and Maps

The software is developed to exemplify and solve dynamical systems like

(Under Examples)
  ODEs: Lorenz system, Rossler system, Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey model
  DDEs: Mackey-Glass System, Equivalent Mackey-Glass System invented by us, Half-wave nonlinear Time-Delay system (Last two have been invented by us)
  Maps: Logistic Map.

In general ODEs, DDEs and Maps may be integrated. The software gives the scope to visualize the the systems in time series and/or phase plane plots. The data may be saved in datafile. The figure may be saved.

It will work on python 2.7

This is software to intrgrate ODEs, DDEs and Maps developed by Dr. Debabrata Biswas (debbisrs@gmail.com) with the kind and useful suggestions of Dr. Tanmoy Banerjee

#To run the software

extract the "dynasyst_0.3.tar.gz" in the home directory and then

python dynasyst.py

#System Requirement:

python, python-numpy, matplotlib, Tkinter, pydelay
